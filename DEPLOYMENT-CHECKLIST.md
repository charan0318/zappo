## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Configuration

### Required Environment Setup:
1. **Update Admin Phone Numbers** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   ```javascript
   // In src/handlers/commandHandler.js line ~670
   const adminNumbers = [
     '919489042245', // Replace with actual admin numbers
     // Add more admin numbers as needed
   ];
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Check .env file contains:
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection
   PRIVY_APP_ID=your_privy_app_id
   PRIVY_APP_SECRET=your_privy_secret
   WHATSAPP_BOT_NUMBER=your_bot_number
   ```

3. **Database Indexes**
   ```bash
   # Ensure MongoDB indexes are created for:
   # - users.phone
   # - transactions.user_phone
   # - claims.token_hash
   ```

## 🚀 Deployment Commands

### Option 1: Standard Node.js Deployment
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start production server
npm start
# OR
node src/index.js
```

### Option 2: PM2 Process Manager (Recommended)
```bash
# Install PM2 globally
npm install -g pm2

# Start with PM2
pm2 start src/index.js --name "zappo-bot"

# Monitor
pm2 status
pm2 logs zappo-bot

# Auto-restart on system reboot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

### Option 3: Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t zappo-bot .

# Run container
docker run -d \
  --name zappo-bot \
  --env-file .env \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  zappo-bot
```

## 📊 Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Health Checks
```bash
# Test basic functionality
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Check WhatsApp connection
# Send test message to bot
```

### 2. Admin Command Testing
```
Admin Phone: Send "/status" 
Expected: System status with uptime, memory, active states

Regular Phone: Send "/status"
Expected: "Access denied" message
```

### 3. Error Handling Testing
```
Send: "send invalid amount"
Expected: User-friendly error with recovery suggestions

Send: "balance" (without wallet)
Expected: Wallet creation suggestion
```

### 4. Transaction Testing
```
Create wallet → Check balance → Send small amount
Expected: Smooth flow without gas restrictions
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Logs

### Log Locations:
- `logs/zappo.log` - Application logs
- `logs/error.log` - Error logs  
- `logs/exceptions.log` - Uncaught exceptions

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
- Unauthorized admin command attempts
- Error frequency by category (WALLET_XXX, TX_XXX, etc.)
- Transaction success rates
- User engagement metrics

### Alerts to Configure:
- High severity errors (NET_XXX, SYS_XXX)
- Admin command unauthorized access
- Service downtime
- Database connection issues

## 🛡️ Security Checklist

- [x] Admin commands secured with phone validation
- [x] No sensitive data in help text
- [x] Error messages don't expose system internals
- [x] All user inputs validated
- [x] Rate limiting considerations documented

## 📞 Emergency Procedures

### If Admin Commands Compromised:
1. Update admin phone numbers immediately
2. Restart service to apply changes
3. Monitor logs for unauthorized attempts
4. Consider adding additional auth layers

### If WhatsApp Connection Issues:
1. Check `/status` admin command for diagnostics
2. Use `/reset` admin command to clear states
3. Restart service if needed
4. Check WhatsApp API status

### If Database Issues:
1. Check MongoDB connection
2. Verify indexes are present
3. Monitor error logs for DB_XXX errors
4. Have backup restoration procedure ready
